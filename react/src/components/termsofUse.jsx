            “Service” does not include Your Data (as defined below) or any software
            application or service that is provided by you or a third party, which
            you use in connection with the Service. Any modifications and new
            features added to the Service are also subject to this TOS. ProBilly
            reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service (or any Service

            provide us with access to an email address, cloud document storage, valid
            calendar. Note that, from time to time, a User’s calendar may become
            disconnected from ProBilly because of a change in the User’s security
            authentication with their calendar provider and the User may be asked to
            reconnect their calendar via the user.probilly.com
          </p>

            account and calendar private, and ProBilly declines all liability if the
            Service is used by a person other than the User or a person authorized by
            the latter, possessing the usernames and passwords to the User’s email
            account.

            information regarding your credit card or another payment instrument. You
            will promptly update your account information with any changes in your
            payment information. You agree to pay ProBilly in accordance with the
            terms set forth on the Site and these TOS, and you authorize ProBilly or
            its third-party payment processors to bill your payment instrument in

            in which case, full payment for invoices issued must be received by the
            date specified in the invoice. Past due fees are subject to a finance
